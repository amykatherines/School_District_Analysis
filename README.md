# PyCity Standardized Testing Analysis

## Overview

PyCity schools asked for an analysis of the latest standardized testing results.  The initial request from the schools was for all data to be summarized into the following resultsets:

* District Wide Results
* School Specific Results
* Math & Reading scores evaluated by
  * Grade
  * School Spending
  * School Size
  * School Type
  
The initial results and data provided created concerns that there was possible acedemic dishonesty in the Thomas High School (THS) 9th grade test scores. The school requested to see all the results without the THS 9th grade included in the averages and percentages. The following analysis is a discussion of how the results were impacted when the subset was removed.

## Results

Below we will present both sets of results to show the impact of removing the THS 9th graders.
